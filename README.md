# @therebot
## Overview
@therebot is a Discord.JS bot that, similar to the @here function in discord (which @mention's *online members*), gives the ability @mention **only offline** members in a Discord Guild/Server.

 The bot will create a role, "there", which will be given to anyone who is offline. If you would like to @mention the offline members, you can use "@there".
 
 **NOTE**: This bot was mainly created for a private discord server, and may not work on all servers.
 
 ## Other Features:
 - Typing "bing" will trigger the bot to respond with "bong".
 - Typing "L" will trigger the bot to respond with "L + ratio"
 - Typing "!help" or /help will show a help page.
 - Typing /summon <trackNumber> <trackExtension> <voiceChannelName> will play the track *<trackNumber>* with the extension *<trackExtension>* in the voice channel *<voiceChannelName>*. You can keep these tracks in an "audio" folder in the root directory.
- Typing "!leave" or /leave will remove the bot form your voice channel.
- Typing "!music <playlist>" or /music <playlist> will play, *in a random order*, the songs in said playlist
